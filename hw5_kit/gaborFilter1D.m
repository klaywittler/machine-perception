function [filter_cos,filter_sin] = gaborFilter1D(T_f, sigma, len)
% This function returns two 1D Gabor quadrature filters
% (vectors).
%
% Unit sampling period; zero is sampled only when filter_length is odd.

% ARGUMENTS
% - T_f: spatial period in pixels
% - sigma: Gaussian envelope sigma
% - len: length of the output

%
% OUTPUT
% filter_cos, filter_sin: (1,len) vectors containing the real part
% and the imaginary part of the filter

% use gaussian1d for the Gaussian envelope

% End of your code %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
