function g = gaussian2d(Sigma, len)
% GAUSSIAN2D - make discrete normalized centered 2D Gaussian
%
% Syntax: g = gaussian2d(Sigma, len);
%
% Output is symmetric with unit sampling period.
% (0,0) is sampled only when len is odd.
%
% Inputs:
%   Sigma: 2x2 covariance matrix
%   len: output is len x len.
