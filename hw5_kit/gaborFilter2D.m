function [filter_cos,filter_sin] = gaborFilter2D(T_f, theta, Sigma, len)
% This function returns two 2D Gabor quadrature filters
% (square matrices).
%
% ARGUMENTS
% - T_f: spatial period in pixels
% - theta: carrier orientation in degrees (0 corresponds
% to oscillation along x-axis only)
% - Sigma: covariance of Gaussian envelope
% - len: output is len x len.
%
% OUTPUT
% filter_cos, filter_sin: two 2d matrices containing the real part
% and the imaginary part of the filter
